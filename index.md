# Hello World

Welcome to my reflection website! My name is Howell Nguyen, but I may be preferred to Howie. I am a student at Cal State Fullerton (https://www.fullerton.edu), graduating around 2027 or 2029 and majoring in computer engineering.

### My 3 Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 1

Lab 1 is the most basic coding assignment of this class, mostly because at that time, students will be coding for the first time. In this code, students will use Linux's terminal to set up git configurations and learn about the basics of using Linux commands. The Linux command I used for this lab is "mkdir", which students use to create a file called "CPSC-120", "cd" which is to change from one folder to another, and "ls" to show the list of objects that are in the file. In addition to setting up the git configuration, I was also able to learn about git commands like "git clone" which downloads a repository for local use, "git commit" which saves all current changes to the code, and "git push" which uploads the code from the current commit to the website. This code is called hello. cc, it shows a basic code where the code would print out "Hello World". I have to do is to just change the "Hello World" to "Hello Howie and my partner's name". After changing it, I also learned about compiling the code with clang++ and using the code with ./a.out. I liked this lab assignment because the code, first of all, was really easy, all I had to do was change the word the code would print. Secondly, it was pretty fun to use this code since we are required to change the message to say my and my partner's name, we can also change the entire message so the code will print out a completely different message. 

* Lab 7, Part 2

In the second part of lab 7, this coding assignment will simulate parking rules if the parking time is valid or not. I have been given five streets, each having different parking rules. These streets are named Ash Street, Beech Street, Cedar Street, Date Street, and Elm Street. In the code, these will be entered as input strings ('ash'). The day, which is labeled as three starting letters of the word, and hours, minutes, and seconds, which are labeled 0-24 (23 means 11 pm) if minutes or 0-59 if minutes or seconds are also considered input strings for this code. This coding assignment let me learn about the use of arithmetic signs in the code, mostly the greater than (>) and less than (<) signs, the code also taught me about the use of and (&&) and or (two vertical bars) in an if statement. Let's use these for an example, let's figure out a code for the parking times on Beech Street. The sign on Beech Street, tells us that parking is closed every Friday for street cleaning from 8 am to 12 pm. So if we want to make a code about the parking rules in Beech Street, we need to make an if statement where if it is Friday from 8 am to 12 pm, parking will be closed. In the if statement, I assigned a string variable day to equal to input string 'Friday'. I then used the ampersand and assigned the integer variable to be greater than or equal to 8. Note that if two or more conditions are listed in ampersands, all conditions have to be met to make it true or false. After that, I also put in ampersands before assigning another hour to be less than or equal to 12. So to conclude, the if statement should be like this: if(day == 'fri' && hour >= 8 && hour =< 12). I like this assignment because it is great practice for me for the if statement since that time I was struggling with these if statements. Making this code was also a really fun challenge since there are different condition in the if statements that I have to work with. Unfortunately, the grading for this must be imporoved because I got everything done on the lab but I got a low point. That was because the unit test for parking.cc failed even though I don't have to edit what's below it.

In the second part of lab 2, we will be making a MadLib about
